# Snowflake Security Analytics
This project is a collection of:
- serverless logic for monitoring assets in different cloud providers
- SQL scripts for processing ingested security data
- Snowalert setup scripts
- BI setup scripts that will work for most BI tools (Tableau, Sigma, PowerBI, Metabase, etc...)

Each component serves as a modular starting point for using Snowflake as a security analytics tool.
